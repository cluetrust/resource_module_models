  notes:
  - Deprecated in VyOS 1.4+, firewalls are no longer connected directly to interfaces.
    See the Firewall Configuration documentation for how to establish a
    connection betwen the firewall rulesets and the flow, interface, or zone.

      - The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and retrieve the current
        running-config to use as a base for comparing against the contents of source.
        There are times when it is not desirable to have the task get the current running-config
        for every task in a playbook.  The I(running_config) argument allows the implementer
        to pass in the configuration to use as the base config for comparison. This
        value of this option should be the output received from device by executing
        command C(show configuration commands | grep 'firewall').
